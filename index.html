            I just got here, okay, Jennifer's here, we're gonna take the new
            truck for a spin. My insurance, it's your car, your insurance should
            pay for it. Hey, I wanna know who's gonna pay for this? I spilled
            beer all over it when that car smashed into me. Who's gonna pay my
            cleaning bill? I still don't understand.Chuck, Chuck, its' your
            cousin.

            This is it. This is the answer. It says here that a bolt of
            lightning is gonna strike the clock tower precisely at 10:04 p.m.
            next Saturday night. If we could somehow harness this bolt of
            lightning, channel it into the flux capacitor, it just might work.
            Next Saturday night, we're sending you back to the future.

          Excuse me. Quiet. Now remember, according to my theory you interfered
          with with your parent's first meeting. They don't meet, they don't
          fall in love, they won't get married and they wont have kids. That's
          why your older brother's disappeared from that photograph. Your sister
          will follow and unless you repair the damages, you will be next. Doc,
          I'm from the future. I came here in a time machine that you invented.
          Now, I need your help to get back to the year 1985. Marty, you
          interacted with anybody else today, besides me?
